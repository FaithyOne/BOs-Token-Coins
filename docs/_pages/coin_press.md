## Coin Press Recipes

The mod use custom recipes for the coins which are calculated by the first use.
But because the mod has a [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) integration you can easily look them up.

## Hopper Support

The coin press has an auto sorting function and will automatically put the items in the correct slot, regardless of the connected face.
**The bottom face will be only use for the output of the corresponding coins.**
